Mini-LibC is a minimalistic C library that implements basic system-level functions, such as malloc, free, puts, and syscall. It is designed to help you understand and work with low-level memory management, error handling, and system calls, offering a foundation for building more advanced libraries.

Files Overview
crt: C runtime files
include: Header files defining function prototypes
io: Functions for input/output handling (e.g., puts)
mm: Memory management functions (e.g., malloc, free)
process: System calls related to process control
stat: File status functions
string: String manipulation functions
Makefile: Build configuration file
